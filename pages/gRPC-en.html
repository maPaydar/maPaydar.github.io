                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to
                            execute
                            in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is coded
                            as if it
                            were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details
                            for the
                            remote interaction.That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the
                            subroutine
                            is local to the executing program, or remote.This is a form of client–server interaction
                            (caller
                            is client, executer is server), typically implemented via a request–response message-passing
                            system.
                            The object-oriented programming analog is remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model
                            implies a
                            level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures is largely the same whether
                            it is
                            local or remote, but usually they are not identical, so local calls can be distinguished
                            from remote
                            calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local
                            calls, so
                            distinguishing them is important.

                        <h3>Message passing</h3>
                        <p>
                            RPC is a kind of request–response protocol. An RPC is initiated by the client, which sends a
                            request message to a known remote server to execute a specified procedure with supplied
                            parameters. The remote server sends a response to the client, and the application continues
                            its process. While the server is processing the call, the client is blocked (it waits until
                            the server has finished processing before resuming execution), unless the client sends an
                            asynchronous request to the server, such as an XHTTP call. There are many variations and
                            subtleties in various implementations, resulting in a variety of different (incompatible)
                            RPC protocols.

                            An important difference between remote procedure calls and local calls is that remote calls
                            can fail because of unpredictable network problems. Also, callers generally must deal with
                            such failures without knowing whether the remote procedure was actually invoked. Idempotent
                            procedures (those that have no additional effects if called more than once) are easily
                            handled, but enough difficulties remain that code to call remote procedures is often
                            confined to carefully written low-level subsystems.

                        <p>
                            To let different clients access servers, a number of standardized RPC systems have been
                            created. Most of these use an interface description language (IDL) to let various platforms
                            call the RPC. The IDL files can then be used to generate code to interface between the
                            client and servers.
                            One of this, is <a href="">gRPC</a> that I want to start it here.

                                        system
                                        initially developed at Google.gRPC clients and servers can run and talk to each
                                        other in
                                        a variety of environments - from servers inside Google to your own desktop - and
                                        can
                                        be
                                        written in any of gRPC’s supported languages. So, for example, you can easily
                                        create
                                        a
                                        gRPC server in Java with clients in Go, Python, or Ruby. In addition, the latest
                                        Google
                                        APIs will have gRPC versions of their interfaces, letting you easily build
                                        Google
                                        functionality into your applications.

                                        In gRPC a client application can directly call
                                        methods on a server application on a different machine as if it was a local
                                        object,
                                        making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services. As in
                                        many
                                        RPC
                                        systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the
                                        methods
                                        that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. On the
                                        server
                                        side,
                                        the server implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client
                                        calls.
                                        On
                                        the client side, the client has a stub (referred to as just client in some
                                        languages)
                                        that provides the same methods as the server.

                                        gRPC clients and servers can run and talk to each other in a variety of
                                        environments
                                        -
                                        from servers inside Google to your own desktop - and can be written in any of
                                        gRPC’s
                                        supported languages. So, for example, you can easily create a gRPC server in
                                        Java
                                        with
                                        clients in Go, Python, or Ruby. In addition, the latest Google APIs will have
                                        gRPC
                                        versions of their interfaces, letting you easily build Google functionality into
                                        your
                                        applications.
